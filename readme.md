# Learning TypeScript

This repository documents my journey of mastering **TypeScript**, a powerful, typed superset of JavaScript. My goal is to enhance code quality, scalability, and development efficiency.

## Why TypeScript?
- **Static Typing**: Catch errors during development.
- **Better Tooling**: Enjoy powerful IDE support.
- **Scalability**: Ideal for large projects.

## Learning Goals
1. Grasp TypeScript fundamentals.
2. Explore integration with **React** and **Node.js**.
3. Build robust, maintainable applications.

Stay tuned for code snippets, projects, and notes!
